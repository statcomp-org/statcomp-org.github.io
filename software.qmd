### {aftgee}: Accelerated Failure Time Model with Generalized Estimating Equations {#aftgee}

![gpl-badge] ![aftgee-dev] [![aftgee-ghs]][aftgee-gh]

{aftgee} provides a collection of methods for both the rank-based estimates and

  (2014, 2015) for details.

  dependence working correlation structure can be specified in GEE's setting.
  See Chiou et al. (2014) for details.

### {sgee}: Stagewise Generalized Estimating Equations {#sgee}

![gpl-badge]

{sgee} provides stagewise techniques implemented with generalized estimating
equations to handle individual, group, bi-level, and interaction selection.
Stagewise approaches start with an empty model and slowly build the model over

selection can be performed. This 'slow brewing' approach gives stagewise
techniques a unique flexibility that allows simple incorporation of
generalized estimating equations. See Vaughan et al. (2017) for details.
