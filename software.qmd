![gpl-badge] ![reda-dev] [![reda-ghs]][reda-gh]

{reda} provides functions for:

1. Simulating survival, recurrent event, and multiple event data from
   stochastic process point of view.
2. Exploring and modeling recurrent event data through the mean cumulative
   function (MCF) or also called the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative

### {splines2}: Regression Spline Functions and Classes {#splines2}

![gpl-badge] ![splines2-dev] [![splines2-ghs]][splines2-gh] [![JDS](https://img.shields.io/badge/JDS-10.6339%2F21--JDS1020-brightgreen)](https://doi.org/10.6339/21-JDS1020)

{splines2} is a supplement package to the base package {splines}.
It provides functions to construct basis matrices of

- B-splines
- M-splines
- I-splines
- convex splines (C-splines)
- periodic splines
- natural cubic splines
- generalized Bernstein polynomials
- their integrals (except C-splines) and derivatives of given order by
  closed-form recursive formulas

In addition to the R interface, {splines2} provides a C++ header-only
library integrated with {Rcpp}, which allows the construction of
spline basis functions directly in C++ with the help of {Rcpp} and
{RcppArmadillo}.
Thus, it can also be treated as one of the Rcpp\* packages.
See Wang and Yan (2021) for details.

### {touch}: Tools of Utilization and Cost in Healthcare {#touch}

![gpl-badge] ![touch-dev] [![touch-ghs]][touch-gh]

{touch} provides R implementation of the software tools developed in the
H-CUP (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project) and AHRQ (Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality).
It contains functions for:

1. Mapping ICD-9 codes to the AHRQ comorbidity measures.
1. Translating ICD-9 (resp. ICD-10) codes to ICD-10 (resp. ICD-9) codes based
   on GEM (General Equivalence Mappings) from CMS (Centers for Medicare and
   Medicaid Services).
